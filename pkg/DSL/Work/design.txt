This paper describes the design and implementation of the
'DistributedList' class.

each element  in a distributed list are serialized to chunk files in a
pre-defined directory <base_dir> on a
distributed file system. Typically, this directory is located in /tmp
or any directory generated using tempdir() or tempfile().
 

Methods:
o length() ... done
o print()  ... done
o [[       ... done
o names()  ... done
o summary()...
o c()	   ... 
o as.list()... [depends on implementation of gather]


Functions:

o lapply   ...
o gather   ...
o reduce   ...

Further todo: 
o think about finalization of DistributedList objects
o tm.plugin.dc depends on DSL package once transition is finished
