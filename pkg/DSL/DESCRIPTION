Title: Distributed Storage and List
Description: A package providing functions and methods for handling distributed storage (DS) and lists (DL). It implements an abstract DistributedList class for storing large list-type objects in a distributed manner. In doing so it uses a well defined storage backend implemented based on the DistributedStorage class. It allows for processing such DLs on distributed systems efficiently.
